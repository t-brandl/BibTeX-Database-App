# Overview
The Application was part of my project for the course `Technical Documentation` in 2020.  
`TeX` and its derivatives, like `LaTeX`, have become indispensable tools in academia, publishing, and professional documentation. Their popularity stems from their ability to produce high-quality, beautifully typeset documents with precision and flexibility that far surpass traditional word processors. It allows easily referencing literature using the `\cite{citation_key}` command. This references an entry from a bibliography database. The most commonly used tool for this is `BibTeX`, which generates `.bib` files that can be included in documents with `\bibliography{bib-name}`. While effective, `BibTeX` has a major limitation: the bibliography database is local. This is inconvenient when working across multiple devices or in academic settings where individuals must maintain separate, potentially redundant databases.

This project addresses the issue by introducing a centralized relational database accessible via a desktop client. The client supports multi-device and multi-user workflows, enabling users to select `TeX` documents, scan them for references, and query the keys from the centralized database. The references are saved in a `.bib` file with the same name in the document's directory. The program can also identify and scan linked `TeX` documents for references, if desired.

Through the clientâ€™s GUI, users can manage the database by adding or removing references. Future updates will allow importing `.bib` files to automatically populate the database, streamlining bibliography management across devices and teams.

  - `javafx-controls`  
  - `javafx-fxml`  
  - `javafx-graphics`

## Font

`The IBM Plex Sans` Font was used in this project. You can find it here:  
https://github.com/IBM/plex  

Simply download the zip and extract the folder `ibm-plex-sans/fonts/complete` to [src/main/resources/IBM Plex Sans Fonts](src/main/resources/IBM%20Plex%20Sans%20Fonts/)

# Usage

1. Set up your PostgreSQL Database, for example using the provided Configuration in [src/main/resources](src/main/resources)
2. Create a `DBconfig.json`, using the provided [DBconfig_template.json](DBconfig_template.json)
3. Run using your preferred IDE or Maven. Entry is the `Driver.java` file

# GUI Description
## Main Menu
![Main menu](documentation/App_MainWindow.png)
The Main Menu contains at the top a Status for the Database Connection. In case of an error, the error will be output here.  
Next is the filepath and dialog to look for files on your system. `.tex` files can be selected here.  
With the following button the `.tex` file and it's linked `.tex`-files (if checked) can be scanned for citation commands.  
The three buttons at the bottom allow the user to add a bibitem or bibfile to the database or remove an item.

## Add Bib Item Dialogue
![Add Item Dialogue](documentation/App_AddItemDialogue.png)

By clicking the `Add Bibitem to Database` button, this dialogue opens, allowing the user to specifiy a bib-item to be added to the Database. Supported Items and their required and optional keys can be found [in the next Chapter.](#bibtex-items-and-keys)

## Add Bib File Dialogue
![Add Bib File Dialogue](documentation/App_AddFileDialogue.png)
By selecting the file via filebrowser on the right, the file can be read. In case of an error, it will be displayed in the `Status` field.

## Remove Item Dialogue
![Remove Item Dialogue](documentation/App_RemKeyDialogue.png)
An item can be removed from the database, if provided the citation key. If the removal process was successful, or if it failed, will be output at the bottom.

# UML Class Diagram
The following uML Class Diagram describes the core functions of the architecture:  
![UML Class Diagram](documentation/UML_relBib.png)

`Bibitem` is the most important class in the document. Every item has an array containing an entry for each of the 23 bibtex keys. The `getItems()` method returns the array, the `toString()` method overrides the default `toString` function to look like a classic entry in a bibtex file, e.g.:
```BibTeX
@conference{Xconference,   
author    = "",
title     = "",
booktitle = "",
editor    = "",
volume    = "",
number    = "",
series    = "",
}
``` 

`outputFiles` manages all the file outout. `writeToBib()` writes the bibliography to a `.bib` file. `updateBibRef()` is not yet implemented.  
`LoadConfigurations` has the task to load configuration files for the database connection. `loadDBconfig()` reads the `DBconfig.json` in the same directory and returns the JDBC URL, username and password.  
`DBAccess` controls all task related to the database. Adding entries to the database, removing entries from them and querying the database for entries.  
`CrawlFiles` has the task of crawling and parsing given documents (`.tex` files) for `cite` and `nocite` commands, as well as `input` and `include`.  
`RelationalBibtexDB` is the core of the application, containing the GUI and event handlers. The GUI was created using `JavaFX` and `.fxml`-files with a `css` stylesheet to ensure consistent styling across all UI windows.

# UML Sequence Diagram
Following Sequence Diagram describes the workflow of the user scanning a `.tex`-file for citations and requesting the missing entries from the shared relational database:
